# Airline Passengers Forecasting with LSTM

This is a toy project that demonstrates time series forecasting using an LSTM model in PyTorch. The project uses the classic Airline Passengers dataset to predict the number of passengers in future months.

## Overview

- **Dataset:** Airline Passengers (monthly data)
- **Goal:** Forecast future passenger numbers using an LSTM model
- **Tools:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy torch scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
